# Zalo for Linux üêß

[![Build Status](https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux/actions/workflows/build.yml)

An unofficial, community-driven port of the Zalo desktop application for **Linux only**, created by repackaging the official macOS client into a standard AppImage.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Known Issues

- **Message Synchronization (E2EE):** Due to missing native macOS libraries for End-to-End Encryption, messages in encrypted chats **will not synchronize** automatically on a fresh install.
- **Workaround:** A community-found solution involves using **Wine** to run the Windows version of Zalo to perform the initial data sync, and then migrating the data to this Linux version. For more details, see [issue #1](https://github.com/realdtn2/zalo-linux-unofficial-2024/issues/1).
- **Can't make any call**
- There is **no Minimize, Maximize or Close button.**
- **No Photos/Videos, Files and Links on the Contact Info panel** for some reason (you can still viewing image/video, file or link like normal, it just don't appear on the contact info like this)

This project is best suited for users who need a native-feeling Zalo client on Linux and are comfortable with the technical workarounds required for full functionality.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. System Requirements
- A 64-bit Linux distribution.
- **`7z` (p7zip-full):** Required to extract the Zalo application.
  ```bash
  # On Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
  ```

### 2. Download Pre-built AppImage (Recommended)

1.  Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux/releases) page.
2.  Download the latest `.AppImage` file.
3.  Make it executable: `chmod +x Zalo-*.AppImage`
4.  Run it: `./Zalo-*.AppImage`

### 3. Build from Source

If you prefer to build it yourself:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/doandat943/zalo-for-linux.git
cd zalo-for-linux

# Install project dependencies (Node.js required)
npm install

# Download and extract the latest Zalo macOS app.
# You can find the latest URL on the Zalo homepage.
DMG_URL="httpsa://res-download-pc-te-vnso-pt-51.zadn.vn/mac/ZaloSetup-universal-25.5.3.dmg" npm run extract-dmg

# Build the AppImage
npm run build
```
The final AppImage will be in the `dist/` directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Scripts

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode without packaging.
- `npm run build`: Packages the application into an AppImage for Linux.
- `npm run extract-dmg`: Only performs the download and extraction step.
- `npm run reset-config`: Deletes the local Zalo data folder (`~/.config/ZaloData`) to fix potential corruption issues.
- `npm run test`: An interactive script for easy local testing and building.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This project is not a from-scratch rewrite of Zalo. It works by:
1.  Downloading the official macOS `.dmg` file.
2.  Using `7z` to extract the `app.asar` archive, which contains the main application logic written in JavaScript.
3.  Removing incompatible native macOS files.
4.  Wrapping the extracted application in a minimal, Linux-compatible Electron shell.
5.  Using `electron-builder` to package everything into a single, portable `AppImage` file.
